# Market-Basket-Analysis
This project performs market basket analysis on transactional data using the FP-Growth algorithm to identify products frequently purchased together. Association rules are evaluated using support, confidence, and lift. Implemented in Python with pandas and mlxtend, the analysis supports cross-selling, product bundling, and inventory decision-making.
